## Methods
The dimensionality  reduction  procedure used to identify the  spatiotemporal sensitivity units (STUs) that significantly contributed to the stimulus-response  relationship,  referred  to  as  effective  STUs. The weighted contribution of these STUs is then evaluated by fitting the S-model [[1](#references)] on the neuron’s spiking response. Algorithm [1](assets/figures/alg1.pdf) describes how we compute the neuron’s effective STUs using the sensitivity indices obtained by Algorithm [2](assets/figures/alg2.pdf), [3](assets/figures/alg3.pdf), and [4](assets/figures/alg4.pdf).
